<h3>A. Inaugural lecture by Prof. Yatagai (21st February, 2015):</h3>
<p>
On the 21st of February, 2015 we were honoured to have Professor Toyohiko Yatagai, President of SPIE deliver our inaugural lecture. He briefed us not only about SPIE and its various activities but also gave us an insight into holography, optical storage devices and upcoming advances in the field of Optics.

<section><h3>B-1. First Outreach Programme (30th June, 2015): </h3>
<p>On the 30th of June, 2015 we conducted our very first outreach activity. We taught and demonstrated basic optical phenomena to fifty students of class 6/7 of Dankuni Sri Ramakrishna Vidyashram. We used the outreach kit sent to us by SPIE to demonstrate reflection, refraction, dispersion and diffraction. Our members also demonstrated the working of a pin hole camera and periscope. We also put to them interesting questions like ‘Why is the sky blue?’ and ‘Why is the sky reddish during sunrise/sunset?’ The response and feedback from the students were overwhelming.

<section><h3>B-2. Second Outreach Programme (29th July, 2015):</h3> 
<p>On the 29th of July we had our second outreach activity at Chetla Boys’ High School. The hundred and fifty (150) odd boys showed a keen interest in our presentation which bought to light various aspects of astronomy and photonics. We started the programme by enlightening the school students about SPIE and IYL 2015. This was followed by a presentation on different celestial objects like stars, planets, comets and how we can spot them in the night sky. We then went on to teach them about primary and secondary colours and the scattering of light. The basic objective of this programme was to generate an interest among students studying in schools which lack laboratories and proper infrastructure. We received great appreciation from both the students and the faculty.

<h3>C. Optical Model Design:</h3>
 
<p>Our chapter members worked hard to build simple but innovative models related to optics and photonics.  Our chapter in its very first year participated in the annual outreach games held at Optics + Photonics, 2015.  We demonstrated total internal reflection and the basic principle of light propagation in an optical fibre by shining a laser torch inside a hole made in a bottle filled with water. We also explained the principle involved in zooming in/ zooming out in a camera using an achromatic doublet, and the phenomenon of refraction by showing how a coin placed inside a glass seems to ‘disappear’ after pouring water into it. 
Our chapter members have also made a 3D hologram and a Lissajous figure generator using small mounted rotating circular mirrors kept at an angle to each other and by shining a laser pointer (signal) on the mirrors. With a little more improvisation in the existing set up, and by using a signal generator we hope to be able to perform simple mathematical operations on the signals and thereby generate more interesting patterns. 
D. Visit to San Diego for attending SPIE Optics + Photonics 2015
2015 conference (8th – 13th August, 2015):  
The President of our Student Chapter, Aishik Biswas represented the Techno India Chapter at the annual SPIE meeting held in San Diego, California from 8th to 13th August. He attended the Student Leadership programme, participated in the Outreach Games and presented our Chapter Activity Poster at the conference. Our handmade poster depicting our Chapter activities made by chapter members was thoroughly appreciated by all including SPIE President elect Dr Robert Lieberman. It was a great learning experience for him where he got to interact with students and scientists from around the world.

<h3>PLANNED ACTIVITIES FOR THE FUTURE:</h3>
<p>
<ol type="1" class="mycolorchange">
<li>
 We would like to conduct more large scale outreach programmes aimed at marginalised sections of society.</li>  
 <li>We would like to organize a lecture series which will feature talks from top scientists working in the field of optics and photonics.</li> 
<li> We will take our students for an industrial visit to the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute, Kolkata in order to get acquainted with the processes involved in the manufacturing of Optical Fibre.</li>
<li>We would like to undertake research projects and construct innovative optical models related to optics and photonics. 
</li><li> We would like to organize various students' events like a student article presentation competition, quiz, photography and  drawing competitions having light as the central theme. </li>
<li> We are also looking forward to organising a free eye check-up camp in association with a leading eye clinic.</li>
 <li>We would like to organize a national/international conference on optics/photonics in the future.</li></ol>
